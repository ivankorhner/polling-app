# Polling App Exercise

The aim and objective of this exercise is to familiarize the new hire with all the core languages and tools we use in Calm (Mainly Golang and Javascript/React) and get some hands-on experience on how to use the main features of Calm.

## Part 1: Creation of Polling App
Requirements from the App:
- Get/Delete/List Polls
- Vote on a Poll (via UI and API)

## Backend Service
The Backend service must be written using Golang. SDKs should be used to integrate your backend service with your database. Poll CRUD and List APIs should be defined and implemented inside this service. An API to vote on a poll should also be implemented.
Later if time permits JWT auth can also be implemented.
